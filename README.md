Briki WP Registration Whitelist
===============================

This is a WordPress plugin I wrote back in April of 2011. It was a request
from a user in the Greek WordPress Users' Forum (wordpress.gr).

This plugin matches a new user's email address against a whitelist of domains, 
during the user registration process, and only allows the registration if the 
email address is under a whitelisted domain. It was written for whatever 
version of WordPress was current back in April 2011. [This blog post][1] (in
Greek) was the "release note".

This plugin is licensed under GPLv2.0, same as WordPress was back then.
